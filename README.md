# Fail-safe-system-to-overcome-remote-control-signal-interference-that-causes-UAVs-to-fall-
To resolve a system failure when data from a remote control is unexpectedly disconnected a file-safe system is required. This fail-safe system is necessary to avoid quadcopters falling at a certain height by utilizing ultrasonic sensors. Ultrasonic sensors are used to control the quadcopter's throttle when it is at an altitude of 1 meter, preventing the quadcopter from falling directly and causing damage.
